# GroupK_Scenario3

Reference app which allows people to create lists of references for their work and projects. They can easily edit, add and delete lists or references on the list.

Everything is easy to use and it is at one click away. The framework used for this is Django (python framework) and we have used a MYSQL db.
The database is currently not available, so if you would like to use it on your own and test it, please modify the connection to the database in the settings file.

This was part of a Scenario Week Project at UCL, where we had to buld a website and deploy it to AWS cloud.
